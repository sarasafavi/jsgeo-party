## What is JS.Geo?

JS.Geo is an annual(ish) gathering for anyone with an enthusiasm for code and maps. In our previous gatherings (in Denver, Portland, Philadelphia, and Boston) speakers included devs from organizations you know as well as indie coders doing creative work outside the traditional geospatial industry. It's a single day event that moves fast so as to maximize the number of interesting people and ideas.

JS.Geo V5 is open to anyone and everyone interested in attending, with a special focus on users, developers, and enthusiasts who work in or near geo-friendly spaces. This year, we’re excited to announce that the event will take place following [GeoRodeo](https://tnris.org/georodeo/) - Austin’s annual gathering of geospatial developers.
